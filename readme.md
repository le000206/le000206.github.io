PROJECT TITLE Self-promo Portfolio Website

BUILT WITH Visual Studio Code

AUTHOR Trang Le Nguyen Phuong

GOAL Base one the previous assignment of User Experience Design course,
the goal is create a portfolio website of myself to show my skills and
works that are completed from last two semesters.

CREATIVE PROCESS I want to create a clean, simple and effective layout
without too much texts since in the design field, it’s best to show the
final results. Mainly using grid with columns and rows for images
layout. CHALLENGES

Navigation bar: As started, I wanted to create a fixed vertical menu for
my navigation bar on the left for desktop version. But after some
research and testing with users by XD file, I realized that stick with
the inline menu would be better for user-friendly and easier for the
coding process. Another challenges is the hamburger menu for the tablet
& mobile version, since this is the first time I tried to do it, it took
me several hours to run it properly. I realized the label (hamburger
icon) could have a big padding invisible area so when the user presses
any near area to the menu, it’ll affect the flow. I fixed that by adding
width for the label to erase that unnecessary area. RESOURCES Font:
